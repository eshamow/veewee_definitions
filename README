These definitions are intended for use with my modified session.rb:

https://github.com/eshamow/veewee/blob/master/lib/veewee/session.rb

This version is current for Veewee version x.x.x

Configurations have been tested against:
Veewee v0.2.0-65-g6096fa8 (current git)
Vagrant 0.8.6
VirtualBox 4.1.4

Please note that these veewee builds will not pass validation testing with the
existing veewee tests, as they don't install Ruby, Puppet, or Chef.  Those
installations are handled in my Vagrant configuration, available shortly
